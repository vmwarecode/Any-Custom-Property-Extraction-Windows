  description: "An example on Windows how one can use a Select-String query to find\
    \ and bind any custom property that is included as part of the payload with a\
    \ provisioned machine in vRA. This software component works by searching the C:\\\
    opt\\vmware-appdirector\\agent\\logs\\darwin-agent*.log file for the desired custom\
    \ property and, through a computed property, sets its value to the value found\
    \ for that custom property. In this example, the custom property name has also\
    \ been parameterized so as to make it configurable outside of the script element\
    \ itself."
